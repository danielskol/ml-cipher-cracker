=================
Consider an alphabet of N letters. A permutation of the alphabet applyed to some message is encruption and the permutation coresponds to encryption key. Therefore, to decrypt cipher one needs find inverse permutation.

ML Cipher Cracker is based on implementation of probabalistic approach to crack transposition cipher.
